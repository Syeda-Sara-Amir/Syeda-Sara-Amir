## 👋 Hi, I’m Syeda Sara Amir

I’m a **student developer** with interests in **robotics, embedded systems, game development, and cybersecurity**. I focus on building hands-on projects that help me understand how software interacts with hardware, networks, and computer systems at a deeper level.

I enjoy working close to the system — learning how code executes, how devices communicate, and how logical decisions turn into real behavior.
