👋 Hi, I’m Syeda Sara Amir

I’m a student developer interested in robotics, embedded systems, game development, and cybersecurity.
I build hands-on projects using both hardware and software to develop a strong understanding of how code interacts with computers, microcontrollers, and networks.
My focus is on practical learning, system-level thinking, and writing logic-driven programs that reflect real-world behavior.

🛠️ Technical Skills
Programming:
  Java — object-oriented design, logic-heavy programs, terminal-based applications
  C++ — system-level programming, embedded logic, performance-focused code

Embedded Systems:
  Arduino & ESP32
    Working with:
      sensors and peripherals
      microcontroller I/O
      basic wireless communication
    
Game & Logic Development:
  Designing logic-based games that emphasize:
    algorithms
    state management
    problem decomposition
    
Cybersecurity & Networking (Foundational):
  Networking fundamentals
  Bluetooth & BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) basics
  Understanding wireless communication and introductory exploitation concepts (for defensive learning)

📌 Selected Project Areas

🤖 Embedded Projects
Building Arduino and ESP32 projects to understand how software controls hardware and executes instructions.

🎮 Game Development
